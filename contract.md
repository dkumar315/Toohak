3. Where will we communicate (e.g. Teams channel, Discord, Messenger)?
- Teams

4. What is a reasonable response time for messages/posts when communicating?
-  6 Hours until 10pm. If it is after 10pm, by next day 10am.

3. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.
- The members in conflict should talk out to each other first.
- If possible, try to solve it internally without involving the group.
- If still not solved, put it in the group and try to mediate with another member.
- If still not resolved, the whole group gets involved to come to a common ground.

4. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. can't meet a deadline or stuck debugging).
- Ask the question you are unsure of and try to attempt it.
- If still unsure, attempt it with a groupmate.
- If still cant, redelegate to someone else.
